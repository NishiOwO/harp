To install this version of Harp, you will need a Unix system
with X11, and Motif (confirmed to be working on 2.3.8).

The current version has been tested on  the  following  sys‐
tems:

 NetBSD (amd64 10.0)

 Debian GNU/Linux (x86_64 12)

Harp should be portable to other UNIX systems. Please let me
know if you port it to other systems, and let me know of any
changes you had to make.
